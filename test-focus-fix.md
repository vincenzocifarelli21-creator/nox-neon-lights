# Test Steps for Input Focus Fix

## Problem Description
Users were experiencing input focus loss after typing the first character in any form field. This was causing them to need to re-click on the input field after every character typed.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the `CustomerContext` saving to localStorage on every state change, which triggered re-renders that caused input fields to lose focus.

## Solution Implemented
1. Added debounced localStorage saving with a 500ms delay
2. Added ref to track initial load to prevent unnecessary saves during component initialization
3. Added proper cleanup of timeout references

## Manual Test Steps
1. Navigate to the signup page: http://localhost:5173/signup
2. Click on any input field (e.g., "First Name")
3. Type multiple characters quickly: "John"
4. ✅ **PASS**: You should be able to type all characters without losing focus
5. ✅ **PASS**: The cursor should remain in the input field throughout typing
6. Test all input fields to ensure the fix works universally:
   - Personal Information fields (firstName, lastName, email, phone)
   - Address fields (address, city, zipCode)
   - Password fields (if account creation is enabled)

## Expected Behavior
- Users can type continuously in any input field
- Input focus is maintained throughout typing
- Data is still saved to localStorage (after 500ms of inactivity)
- Form validation still works correctly

## Additional Verification
- Check browser's Local Storage to confirm data is being saved after typing stops
- Verify that page refreshes still load previously entered data
- Test that form submission works correctly
